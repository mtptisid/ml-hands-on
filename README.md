## 📊 Datasets

### 🏘️ `Home_price_list.csv`

Basic dataset with features like:
- Area
- Number of bedrooms
- Price

### 🏡 `Housing.csv`

Found in `new_approach/`, includes:
- Advanced features
- More room for experimentation

---

## 🧠 Notebooks Summary

### 📘 `Home_price_prediction.ipynb`

- Loads and explores dataset
